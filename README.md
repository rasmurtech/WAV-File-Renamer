## WAV File Renamer
This script renames all WAV files in a specified folder to have a numerical name in ascending order.

## Usage
Run the script using Python 3.
Enter the path to the folder containing the WAV files when prompted.
The script will rename all WAV files in the folder to have a numerical name in ascending order.

## Example
If the folder contains the following files:

song.wav
another_song.wav
third_song.wav

After running the script, the files will be renamed to:

 - 001.wav
 - 002.wav
 - 003.wav
